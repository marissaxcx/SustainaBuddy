# SustainaBuddy

SustainaBuddy is an iOS app built with SwiftUI that gamifies sustainable living. Care for your sea-creature buddy, track eco activities, and share progress with friends — now with Sign in with Apple integration.

## Features
- Marine tracker and animal profiles
- Tamagotchi-style buddy care and customization
- Eco footprint and dining suggestions
- Social challenges and achievements
- Real Sign in with Apple (AuthenticationServices)

## Requirements
- Xcode 15 or later
- iOS 17 Simulator or device

## Getting Started
1. Open the project in Xcode: `SustainaBuddy.xcodeproj`
2. Select an iOS Simulator (e.g., iPhone 16 Pro)
3. Run the app (⌘R)

Or via CLI:
```
xcodebuild -scheme SustainaBuddy -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' -configuration Debug build
```

## Sign in with Apple
- Ensure the target has the "Sign In with Apple" capability enabled.
- On Simulator, the Apple sign-in sheet opens; final auth may require testing on a physical device signed into iCloud.

## Screenshots
Add screenshots to showcase the app for GitHub/LinkedIn viewers.

## Roadmap
- Cloud sync for profiles and activity logs
- More buddy species, outfits, and accessories
- Community feed and richer social features
